## Background

The development of CodeGuardian is motivated by the challenge of maintaining high code quality and consistency in software development projects hosted on GitLab. Traditional manual code reviews, while crucial, can be slow and subject to human error, leading to potential inconsistencies and defects. CodeGuardian leverages AI technology, inspired by Ollama and specifically utilizing the `codellama` AI model, to automate the code review process. By analyzing code submissions through GitLab merge request webhooks, CodeGuardian provides immediate, intelligent feedback on code quality, style, potential bugs, and performance issues. This automation aims to enhance review efficiency, enforce coding standards, and improve the overall quality of the software.

## Requirements

### Must Have

1. Integration with GitLab via webhooks for merge request notifications.
2. Analysis of code diffs in merge requests using the `codellama` AI model.
3. Generation of review comments on code quality, style, potential bugs, and performance optimizations.
4. Support for Python as the primary programming language for backend development.
5. Posting of review summaries directly in GitLab merge request comments.

### Should Have

1. Customizable rules and guidelines for code reviews.
2. Ability for the AI model to learn and adapt from past reviews.
3. Integration with GitLab CI/CD pipelines for automated review triggers.

### Could Have

1. A dashboard for tracking code quality trends, review activities, and common issues.

### Won't Have (for now)

1. Real-time pair programming or live code review sessions.
2. Automated merging based on AI reviewer approvals.

## Method

CodeGuardian is designed to integrate seamlessly with GitLab, triggering an AI-powered code review process via merge request webhooks. The core of the system is the `codellama` AI model, which analyzes code diffs to generate actionable feedback, later posted back as comments on the GitLab merge request.

### Architecture Overview

The workflow begins with a GitLab merge request event, captured by a webhook that notifies CodeGuardian. The webhook receiver parses the event, extracting necessary information like the merge request ID and code diffs, which are then analyzed by `codellama`. The feedback generated by the AI model is formatted into comments and submitted back to the GitLab merge request.

### Key Components

- **Webhook Receiver**: Captures and processes GitLab webhook events.
- **Review Orchestrator**: Manages the flow between the receiver, `codellama`, and the GitLab API client.
- **`codellama` AI Reviewer**: The AI model that analyzes the code and provides feedback.
- **GitLab API Client**: Posts the AI-generated feedback as comments on GitLab.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Environment Setup

- Prepare the GitLab project and obtain `codellama` API access.
- Set up the development environment with Python and necessary libraries.

### Step 2: Webhook Receiver Service

- Develop a service to receive and parse GitLab webhook events.

### Step 3: Integration with `codellama`

- Implement code diff extraction and submission to `codellama`, and handle the feedback.

### Step 4: Posting Reviews to GitLab

- Format the `codellama` feedback into comments and post them to the GitLab merge request.

### Step 5: Testing and Deployment

- Conduct local and real-world testing, then deploy the service and configure the GitLab webhook.

### Step 6: Monitoring and Maintenance

- Implement logging, monitoring, and a feedback loop for continuous system improvement.

## Milestones
